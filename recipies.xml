<name>Potato Tacos with Mexican Rice and</name>
<note>0</note>
<archive>0</archive>
<ingredient>tomato sauce
cilantro
1/3 of an onion.</ingredient>
<method>For the tacos (feeding three people), 
I boiled five peeled and chopped russet potatoes.

Once they were boiled and soft, 
I drained and placed them back in the pot, 
and mashed them seasoned salt, to taste. 
For just yourself, I&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;d say do two potatoes. 
I used the corn tortillas (I fried mine, 
but you definitely don&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;t have to) and 
we each had three tacos. 
I garnished the tacos with a diced tomato, 
the rest of the lettuce and an avocado that 
I had from last week (it was the only time I 
used something not on the list).

With the Mexican rice, 
I followed the recipe but  I used 1/3 of my onion, 
my leftover tomato sauce, 
and added a handful of cilantro before I let it steam. And with the Bean Dip, 
I only used 1/3 of an onion.</method>
